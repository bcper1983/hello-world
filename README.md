Hello Humans! 

This is Bo. Well, I'd like to learn as much as I can about coding. Perhaps it's too late for me to be a 'ninja' but if I can code enough to be useful then that's quite ok with me! I also would love to work spreading the power of code to vulnerable and disadvantaged youth around the world!
